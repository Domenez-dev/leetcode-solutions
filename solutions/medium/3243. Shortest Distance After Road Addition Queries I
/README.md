Problem: Shortest Path After Adding a Road  
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-after-adding-a-road/

Complexity:

- Time: O(n^3), where n is the number of nodes (due to the Dijkstra algorithm run for each query).
- Space: O(n^2), as the graph is stored in an adjacency matrix.
- Runtime (LeetCode): 100ms (75%)
