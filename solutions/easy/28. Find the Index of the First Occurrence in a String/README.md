**Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

**Complexity**:

- **Time**: O(n \* m), where n is the length of `haystack` and m is the length of `needle`, due to the nested loop checking each substring.
- **Space**: O(1), as only a few variables are used.
- **Runtime (LeetCode)**: 0 ms (100%)
