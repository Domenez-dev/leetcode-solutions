Problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Complexity:

- **Time**: O(n + m), where n is the length of `list1` and m is the length of `list2`. Each node of both lists is visited once.
- **Space**: O(n + m), due to the recursive call stack when merging the lists.

Performance:

- **Runtime (LeetCode)**: 0ms (100%)
