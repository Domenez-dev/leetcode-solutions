Problem: Roman to Integer  
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/

Complexity:

- **Time**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed at most twice (once directly and once during subtraction checks).
- **Space**: O(1), as the space usage does not grow with the input size. The mapping of Roman numerals and a few variables are the only additional storage.
- **Runtime (LeetCode)**: 46ms (5%)
