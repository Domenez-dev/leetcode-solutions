# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems written in Go.

## Structure

The solutions are categorized by difficulty:

- **Easy**: `solutions/easy`
- **Medium**: `solutions/medium`
- **Hard**: `solutions/hard`

Each solution has:

- `main.go`: The Go implementation.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the solution.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to a solution's directory.
2. copy the solution to the leetcode problem that is linked in the readme file.
3. Chose go for programming language in leetcode and run tests.

## Notes

1. Readme files contains leetcode problem link and explanation of the solution.
2. The solutions are not necessarily the most idiomatic and optimal ones.
3. some solutions can have test cases that are not covered by the leetcode problem, this is because I have added some extra test cases to make sure the solution is correct.
4. If you want to create your own leetcode repository, you can use the `leetcode_init.sh` script to create the directory structure and files for you :).

Happy coding!
